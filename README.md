# Heart-Disease-Prediction
It is done using Linear regression using python
first you have to collect the data from the users like(age,blood pressure rate,sugar levels,health conditions)
you have to train the data set then your accurate algorithm works based on given trained data set.
it uses linear regression algorithm to detect the heart disease affected persons based on the given data in the dataset
